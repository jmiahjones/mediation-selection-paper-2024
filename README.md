# Code for the JRSSB Submission "Causal Mediation Analysis: Selection with Asymptotically Valid Inference"

The code in this repository reproduces the simulation results as well as the data application.

- mediation-star-study: This applies the method to the data application and can reproduce Tables 2 and 3.
- mediationSelection: This applies the method to Simulation A and can reproduce Figure 1 and Table 1. This was the most computationally involved method.
- mediation-new-sims: All other simulation settings were captured here and do not involve the computationally-intensive machine learning component of the method.
